# Google Play Games Input SDK for Unity

The Input SDK provides a unified interface that allows players to
view and change the mouse and keyboard bindings for any game they wish to play
on Google Play Games on PC.

This is an auto-generated Unity SDK based on our Java SDK using
[Library Wrapper](https://developer.android.com/games/develop/custom/wrapper).
